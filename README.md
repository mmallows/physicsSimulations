# physicsSimulations

BounceBallControl.java is the main file that can be compiled and run. The other files are just the various panes for each tab
of the GUI. In this collection of short programs, there is an example of one-dimensional elastic collisions, two-dimensional
elastic collisions, and a tool I created that can solve basic projectile motion problems you would encounter in a basic physics
course. There is a text field in the two-dimensional elastic collision example that displays the total momentum in the system
at any given point in time. It does vary a bit after each collision, but it does show that the system does more or less
maintain a conservation of momentum. Sometimes there are issues with collisions between objects or against the side of the pane,
but for the most part it's decent. The point is to display my ability to program in an object-oriented language to fulfill
a purpose. This was just a fun project for me to work on during the summer after my first year at Saint Michael's and it was
really fun to work on and it really only took a few days to complete. I've looked back at it over breaks and checked some of
the math and made some small tweaks but it's been functional since I first made it that summer. Please check it out and I hope
it can be helpful or is just interesting or fun for somebody to look at.
