# physicsSimulations

BounceBallControl.java is the main file that can be compiled and run. The other files are just the various panes for each tab
of the GUI. In this collection of short programs, there is an example of one-dimensional elastic collisions, two-dimensional
elastic collisions, and a tool I created that can solve basic projectile motion problems you would encounter in a basic physics
course. There is a text field in the two-dimensional elastic collision example that displays the total momentum in the system
at any given point in time. It does vary a bit after each collision, but it does show that the system does more or less
maintain a conservation of momentum. Sometimes there are issues with collisions between objects or against the side of the pane,
but for the most part it's decent. The point is to display my ability to program in an object-oriented language to fulfill
a purpose. I made the two-dimensional collisions example during the summer after my first year at Saint Michael's College and 
have gone back to add the other pieces during breaks since then. It's been a fun project for me and has kept me refreshed in some
basic Java programming and also let's me review some of the physics concepts I learned in high school while taking AP mechanical
physics.
